Hi All, A while back I lost interest in gaming (Don't really have the time anyway) and I'm in the process of selling off my old accounts. I don't need them, so others may as well get enjoyment out of it. Like the title says, this is a PSN account based in the EU region. It may have a few games on the account for the PS3 and PS Vita systems, but it's predominantly all for the PS4. Below is a list of the games on the account for download. Note that this is only titles that can be downloaded. I got dying light last week second hand for the ps4 and I was pleased to find that I got a free cuisine and cargo code with my game, wasn't planning on getting it but hey I've got it and I might as well use it. Should I get the Following? I've already racked up 70 hours in my first playthrough and 8 on my second Edit: I don't have much money to buy it but should This story is a spinoff of the Uplift Protocol series written by u/CalmBeforeTheEclipse. His account is deleted, but his stories are still posted here (https://www.reddit.com/r/hfy/wiki/series/uplift_protocol). Like many, I felt like original Uplift Protocol slipped from being an interesting Social Sci-Fi story to something resembling a young adult novel. Too much interpersonal drama and not enough substance. I liked the universe's potential, though, so I thought I'd take it for a ride. I bought this key before noticing I cannot activate it in Germany. It works literally anywhere else. Needs: Base Game "Dying Light" - which I recommend! Includes: "The Following" DLC "The Bozak Horde"-Modus "Be the Zombie"-Modus "Cuisine amp Cargo"-Missions It would mean the world to me, if you could buy this off me, I feel genuinely stupid. I bought it for 12€, so it's a good price. I just bought Dying Light Enhanced Edition for PS4, however I'm a bit confused at to what DLC is included with this game, and what can be uniquely purchased separately. Is it safe to say the following are not on the disc?: Gun Psycho Bundle Harran Ranger Bundle Volatile Hunter Bundle Crash Test Bundle White Death Bundle Vintage Gunslinger Bundle Other items that show up for sale in the PSN Store include Cuisine amp Cargo, The Bozak Horde, and The Following.Bozak Horde 
One of the most asked questions here demonstrates confusion over the purchasing options for Dying Light. This is my attempt to help explain them. (This information is the same for PC or console). Dying Light was originally released in January of 2015, along with a Season Pass that was to include planned DLC content for the rest of the year. Techland actually extended this to 13 months, and included DLC content released in February of 2016, for Season Pass customers, as well. This eventually. Author's note: Hello guys, So, this is a bit embarrassing but I've decided to make a go at something I've not considered after some people suggested it to me. I've made a patreon page. If you would like to support me, you can now do so financially. Every little bit would be greatly appreciated. Anyways, you always find my work here for your enjoyment. you could use the link below if you choose to do so: https://www.patreon.com/Soopah_Fly See you guys in the next chapter! Hi, I dunno if I should buy the Season Pass for complete my game. I have this : Harran Military Rifle Be The Zombie Buzz Killer Weapon Pack Cuisine amp Cargo Custom Map Custom Map 2 Night Club Weapon Pack Ninja Outfit Punk Queen Weapon Pack Special Agent Outifit The Bozak Horde The Constable Weapon Pack The Following The Lacerator Weapon Pack Urban Explorer Outfit Wrench Kiss Weapon Pack Dying Light Ultimate Survivor Bundle Crash Test Skin Pack AShoul. PC Dying Light - 14.99€ Season Pass - 11.35€ Dying Light Exclusive Pack - 1.42€ The Following - 7.50€ The Bozak Horde - 3.99€ Ultimate Survivor - 1.09€ Cuisine amp Cargo - 1.80€ Be The Zombie - 0.39€ Lacerator Just post a comment here and I'll give them to you in a PM. Do note that I do NOT know if they work or not so please don't get your hopes up too much. I'll post an edit if I still have any left. Otherwise I will probably remove the post when they are all given out. Dying Light - Ultimate Survivor Bundle Dying Light - Be The Zombie Mode Dying Light - Cuisine amp Cargo Tell me later if they actually worked :) Edit - Codes for Steam Edit2 - Be the zombie mode has been given away. I noticed that the Dying Light season pass is only .99 right now on the ps store. And that comes with ultimate survivor bundle, cuisine amp cargo, and the Bozak horde DLC. I also noticed from new videos that The Following DLC will be .99 but in a interview I saw, he said it will be included in the season pass. So wouldn't it just be smarter to buy the season pass now since it'll only be  more and it supposably includes The Following? Or am I missing something. Alright, I'm a bug sucker for zombie games. I'm always enticed to buy dlc packs/season passes for these games (which i never buy for regular games), and now Techland has messed up again with its dlc. Cuisine amp Cargo is bullsh . I really love Dying Light and techland has done a formidable job of this game, unlike its previous endeavors. I loved the game so a week later after the game released, I cashed in for the season pass. Cusine and cargo is dlc that gives players merely access Back in December details for the upcoming DLC for Dying light were released: Cuisine amp Cargo -- Available first for Season Pass holders, these two hardcore missions let players put their skills to the ultimate test. Investigate buildings sealed off in the very first days of the outbreak--with the infected inside. Explore ominous corridors of once the most famous restaurant in Harran, and employ both stealth and combat to ransack a zombie-filled loading bay at an abandoned railroad. 
This story is a sequel to part 2 ( and is based in the Jverse created by /u/Hambone3110. Where appropriate, units have been changed, and replaced with human numbers in square brackets. Enjoy! ampnbsp; --- ampnbsp; 6Y 1M 2W 6D BV ampnbsp; Toby crept through his house, trying not to step on the squeaky floorboard by the kitchen door. He heard the TV droning in the living room, some kind of sport commentary. He wrinkled his nose as he stepped Hello guys! Today I will be giving away free Dying Light DLC Codes for the Playstation 4. There are 3 codes in total. Everyone who wants one or all of the codes, simply comment if you want a specific one or all of them. I will put your name into a box and just draw one name at random for each code. If you are interested in all of them, I will put your name in all of the different boxes. Note that those codes DO NOT work on the german PSN store. These are the codes available: "Be the Zombie. From email sent today Important Announcement: To all survivors! We’re so excited to say that Dying Light: The Following – Enhanced Edition is coming to PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the PC with the launch date set to February 9th, 2016. This definitive zombie experience will include an enhanced version of the original game, the expansion pack Dying Light: The Following, The Bozak Horde mode, the Be the Zombie mode, the Cuisine amp Cargo challenge missions, the Ultimate Survivor Bundle 
I haven't revisited this game since I 100%'d it but from what I am reading on some of these posts is that 2 out of the 3 DLC's in the Season Pass we're actually given out free to players, is this correct? I have heard about Cuisine amp Cargo being free (which it should be after having beat it in under an hour), is this true? Also I have heard about the Ultimate Survivor Bundle being free as well, is this true? One of the reasons I bought the pass, being an aesthetics type of guy, different.
